    <h1>Mapping the Hittite Empire</h1>

    <div>
      Every argument about the past presents a narrative that reshapes our
      understanding of the present. Mapping ancient empires is one such argument—
      specifically, an argument about past political structures. A map can portray
      an empire as a solid, far-reaching authority or as a fragile network whose
      power depends on many interconnected parts.
      Scholars produce countless maps of empires, yet the same versions are often
      reproduced again and again. As a result, we rarely pause to ask why a
      particular map was created or what kinds of evidence it rests upon.

      In this case study, we examine the Hittite Empire and how its territoriality has been represented in scholarly maps. While scholars have described Hittite territoriality as a dynamic and multilayered phenomenon—shaped by shifting political, administrative, and local interactions—we are still seeking effective ways to translate these ideas into cartographic form. Our goal is to deconstruct these maps by making their underlying arguments about Hittite territoriality explicit. We aim to be transparent about the choices involved in map-making, while also reflecting on how we conceptualize political control and territoriality in the Late Bronze Age. </p>
